This article is a guide to understanding the pros and cons of open- and closed-source approaches. Among the open-source LLMs, only Llama2 achieved a score slightly above this level. In contrast, GPT-4 was significantly better with a score of 73.3% (P<0.01 vs. Claude 2 and the open-source LLMs), whereas Claude 2, although more successful than the open-sourced LLMs, performed more poorly than GPT-4 with a score of 54.4% (P<0.001).

S ince the release of ChatGPT has sparked developers' interest in building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), proprietary closed source foundation models, especially by OpenAI, have been dominating the market. OpenAI's foundation model, gpt-3.5-turbo, which powers ChatGPT, is often the default LLM in programming tutorials. Training large language models demands extensive computational resources. OpenAI spent millions training GPT-3 on cloud infrastructure, while Anthropic consumed upwards of $10 million worth of GPUs for ConstitutionalAI. The bill for such models excludes most individuals and small teams from the open source community. Databricks has introduced the DBRX model, a general-purpose large language model that supports customization through training and tuning. DBRX surpasses current open-source LLMs like Llama 2 70B and Mixtral-8x7B on key industry benchmarks, including language understanding, programming, math, and logic. Select your Champion!\n",
