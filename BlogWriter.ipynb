This article is a guide to understanding the pros and cons of open- and closed-source approaches. Among the open-source LLMs, only Llama2 achieved a score slightly above this level. In contrast, GPT-4 was significantly better with a score of 73.3% (P<0.01 vs. Claude 2 and the open-source LLMs), whereas Claude 2, although more successful than the open-sourced LLMs, performed more poorly than GPT-4 with a score of 54.4% (P<0.001).

S ince the release of ChatGPT has sparked developers' interest in building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), proprietary closed source foundation models, especially by OpenAI, have been dominating the market. OpenAI's foundation model, gpt-3.5-turbo, which powers ChatGPT, is often the default LLM in programming tutorials. Training large language models demands extensive computational resources. OpenAI spent millions training GPT-3 on cloud infrastructure, while Anthropic consumed upwards of $10 million worth of GPUs for ConstitutionalAI. The bill for such models excludes most individuals and small teams from the open source community. Databricks has introduced the DBRX model, a general-purpose large language model that supports customization through training and tuning. DBRX surpasses current open-source LLMs like Llama 2 70B and Mixtral-8x7B on key industry benchmarks, including language understanding, programming, math, and logic. Select your Champion!\n",

       "\"Introduction:\\nThe debate between open source and closed source Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complex issue with both benefits and drawbacks to each approach. In this analysis report, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of open source LLMs and closed source LLMs in terms of control, cost savings, innovation, transparency, security, and performance.\\n\\nOpen Source LLMs:\\n1. Control: With open-source LLMs, you have control over the model, its training data, and its applications. This gives users the flexibility to modify and adapt the model for specific tasks or industries.\\n2. Transparency: Open source models provide full visibility into their inner workings, which can help build trust with customers by offering a transparent AI solution.\\n3. Innovation: The open-source community is known for its innovation and ability to quickly adapt to new technologies, making open source LLMs likely to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.\\n4. Cost savings: Efficiently optimizing an open source LLM can reduce latency and increase performance, potentially leading to cost savings in the long run.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Open Source LLMs:\\n1. Performance: While open source models offer flexibility, they may not always perform as well as closed source models due to limited resources or expertise for optimization and maintenance.\\n2. Customization: Achieving customized performance with open source LLMs can be an uphill battle, as it often requires significant effort and resources.\\n\\nClosed Source LLMs:\\n1. Security: Being able to inspect code and having visibility into algorithms allows enterprises more trust, assisting with audits and ensuring ethical and legal compliance.\\n2. Cost savings: Hybrid and targeted AI Models supplements - and maybe overtakes - closed-source LLMs in performance, potentially leading to cost savings in the long run.\\n3. Performance: Closed source models may outperform open source models due to specialized optimization and maintenance efforts.\\n4. Innovation: While not as fast-paced as open source, closed source models can still innovate within their proprietary environment.\\n5. Customization: Closed-source models offer the potential for more customized performance tailored to specific industries or tasks.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Closed Source LLMs:\\n1. Transparency: The lack of transparency in closed source models can lead to a loss of trust with customers who may prefer a more open and auditable AI solution.\\n2. Innovation pace: The innovation pace within closed-source environments might not be as rapid as the open-source community, which could result in falling behind on advancements.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nBoth open source and closed source LLMs have their pros and cons, and the choice between them depends on various factors such as control, cost savings, transparency, security, performance, and innovation pace. Open source LLMs provide flexibility, transparency, and potential cost savings but may suffer from limited performance and customization. Closed source LLMs offer security, customization, and potentially better performance but can lack transparency and innovation speed. The best approach ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of an organization or individual using the AI model.\\n\\nThis is VERY VERY long.
